As I've gotten older and gained perspective on my life, I've concluded that many aspects of my personality and career have been broadly shaped by the era, location, and community of my childhood. In this blog series, "How I got Here," I plan to retrospect on a few different periods of my life and some of their lasting influences on my professional pursuits and hobbies.

[In chapter three, I discussed the dark three year period when I went through substantial bullying at school.](/how-i-got-here-chapter-2) This chapter covers the next thee years from 1998 until around 2001, when I regained confidence, got my first technology job, and then shifted interests after the dot-com bust.

### Chapter 4: Bouncing Back and Regaining my Confidence

By the time I got to high school, my computer hobby turned into a pretty-great part-time job when I turned 15. My public school district hired me to unbox and setup PCs, get them setup on the intranet, uninstall the default bloatware and install the school district's bloatware, and test that the printers worked. I used my earnings to get my driver's license, open an IRA, and "invest in myself" by earning the CompTIA A+ certification. The guy at the testing center said that I was the youngest person he'd seen pass the test, and that made me feel pretty good. What didn't make me feel good was when my boss declined my request for a raise based on my new credential. That taught me an early lesson about the value of tech certifications. Needless to say, I never took the Network+ exam.
