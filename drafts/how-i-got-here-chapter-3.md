As I've gotten older and gained a bit more perspective on my life, it's clear that many of the core aspects of my personality and the professional directions I've taken over my career were broadly shaped by the location and community of my childhood.

. In my case, I grew up in [Fairfield, California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield,_California), a distant exurb of the San Francisco Bay Area directly adjacent to a major Air Force base. This exposed me to the computers and the military much more than the average person.

My obsession with computers and struggle with bullies led me to fail out of seventh grade

I began playing games online and write custom mods and skins.

By the time I got to high school, my computer hobby turned into a pretty-great part-time job when I turned 15. My public school district hired me to unbox and setup PCs, get them setup on the intranet, uninstall the default bloatware and install the school district's bloatware, and test that the printers worked. I used my earnings to get my driver's license, open an IRA, and "invest in myself" by earning the CompTIA A+ certification. The guy at the testing center said that I was the youngest person he'd seen pass the test, and that made me feel pretty good. What didn't make me feel good was when my boss declined my request for a raise based on my new credential. That taught me an early lesson about the value of tech certifications. Needless to say, I never took the Network+ exam.

### JROTC, West Point, and the Army (2001 - 2008)

Beyond computers, my one other big interest at this stage was the military. Both of my grandfathers were veterans, and hearing their stories made me associate military with interesting experiences and character development. Plus, since my high school was right by a major Air Force base, most of my classmates were the children of military families. As the one person in my eighth grade class that couldn't afford to go on the Washington DC class trip, hearing them talk about living outside of California (or even abroad) seemed exciting. This led me to join my high school Junior ROTC unit.

In contrast to computers, which had always been a very solitary activity that involved interact more with adults than people my own age, JROTC was the first time that I was able to develop a sense of comradery and friendship. To this day, my best friend remains Aser Tolentino, a fellow JROTC cadet. So when the dot-com bubble burst and the 9/11 attack happened, I shifted my priorities around. Rather than trying to get a tech job, I decided to instead join the military. I applied to West Point, VMI, and the Citadel based on the suggestions of my instructors, and I planned to enlist in the Army if I didn't get into one of those. Ultimately, I got into West Point, which took my life in a very different direction.

Thinking back, my experiences at West Point and in the Army turned me into a gritty person that's comfortable stepping in to lead when needed. I excelled at academics, did reasonably well leading teams, and sucked at pushups. I got a C+ in Gymnastics, and I raised my hands in praise to the heavens that I didn't failed. I got punched in the face in boxing, I drove a tank around during summer training, and I did a semester abroad at the German Military Academy, which gave me my first taste of traveling overseas. I got a pair of crossed sabers mounted on a plaque for doing well in computer science coursework. Those sabers and my lingering affinity for strong types are that only thing that I've ever really gotten out of learning [Ada 95, a computer language you've likely never heard of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xpFKvWgC7Q).

If the Army had had Cyberwarfare Officers back when I was commissioned, I think I likely would have gone that route, but alas, I was a decade early. Instead I chose what I thought best combined my technical interests with my warrior spirit: Aviation. I envisioned targeting computers, cool headsets, hellfire missiles flying down at the enemy. I did great at that [TIE-Fighter game](https://youtu.be/ZB_NSpUmIUU?t=38s), so this must be a cinch. I showed up at flight school pumped for my future career. Nine months later, I was judged medically unfit to fly. Nine months after that, I was medically discharged and again a civilian.

### Fighting depression and the Great Recession by returning to Tech (2008 - Present)

As hard as it is to imagine now with the markets going gangbusters, back when I was discharged in December 2008, hiring was frozen, people were still getting laid off left-and-right, and my childhood home was getting foreclosed on. I remember spending days handcrafting a cover letter for an $50k/year IT Help Desk position at a VA Hospital, only to get rejected in favor of one of the many laid off tech workers flocking to something secure with health insurance. Like many millennials, I ended up taking refuge in grad school, first at Georgetown and then later at Illinois Tech. I learned Java and this new thing called AWS, and I was able to network my way into a job at IBM, kicking off my post-Army career in tech.

The eight years of my tech career has been blur of different projects that required me to learn new skills. Broadly, I rode the initial hype wave of cloud computing. I worked on cloud management tools at IBM, evangelized modern cloud architectures at the FAA, and now I build AI-powered IT operations tools at Decipher. As time allowed, I took on side gigs during nights and weekends, largely using JavaScript and PHP. I'd always found web development to be a better creative outlet than writing Enterprise things in Java or automating cloud deployments in Python, so when I finally got a bit more financially secure, I pivoted to shift from backend languages to fullstack JavaScript via a nanodegree at Udacity and a three-month sabbatical to complete the Fullstack Academy Software Engineering program on a veteran scholarship.

Since the web development community is super young, I now generally find myself playing the role of senior engineer on most projects. This has forced me to stretch my leadership and coaching muscles a bit and dedicate time to work through my reading list of software engineering books. It's kinda weird, but I'm getting to the point where I like reading about design patterns and agile methodologies. Whoda thunk it? I've also gotten to the point where people I've mentored have started to go gangbusters as software journey(wo)men. This makes me feel a bit like a software O.G. (original gangsta), but the constant churn of frontend technologies forces me to keep on my toes and regularly delivers the sort of dopamine burst i first got when I popped in the Windows 95 CD-ROM and my mid-90s homebuilt PC first came to life.

It's hard to say what language or frameworks I might be using a few years from now, but I feel like my nerdy technical chops and my military grit put me in a good place to keep up. Each passing year, I feel like my rough edges are getting a bit more worn down, helping me become a better version of myself. I also become more cognizant of the many small blessings that have allowed me to live this amazing life.
