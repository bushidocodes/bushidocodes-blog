As I've gotten older and gained perspective on my life, I've concluded that many aspects of my personality and career have been broadly shaped by the era, location, and community of my childhood. In this blog series, "How I got Here," I plan to retrospect on a few different periods of my life and some of their lasting influences on my professional pursuits and hobbies.

[In chapter two, I discussed my two year quest from 1993 to 1995 to get a home computer, which ultimately lead me to build my own PC shortly after the release of Windows 95.](/how-i-got-here-chapter-2) This chapter covers the next thee years from 1995 until around 1998, when I bloomed into a serious computer nerd and began to experience significant bullying.

### Chapter 3: Bullying, Cynicism, and Failure

My obsession with computers and struggle with bullies led me to fail out of seventh grade

I began playing games online and write custom mods and skins.
