As I've gotten older and gained perspective on my life, I've concluded that many aspects of my personality and career have been broadly shaped by the era, location, and community of my childhood. In this blog series, "How I got Here," I plan to retrospect on a few different periods of my life and some of their lasting influences on my professional pursuits and hobbies.

[In chapter three, I discussed the dark three year period when I went through substantial bullying at school.](/how-i-got-here-chapter-2) This chapter covers the next thee years from 1998 until around 2001, when I regained confidence, got my first technology job, and then shifted interests after the dot-com bust.
