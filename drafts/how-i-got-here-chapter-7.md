As I've gotten older and gained perspective on my life, I've concluded that many aspects of my personality and career have been broadly shaped by the era, location, and community of my childhood. In this blog series, "How I got Here," I plan to retrospect on a few different periods of my life and some of their lasting influences on my professional pursuits and hobbies.

[In chapter three, I discussed the dark three year period when I went through substantial bullying at school.](/how-i-got-here-chapter-2) This chapter covers the next thee years from 1998 until around 2001, when I regained confidence, got my first technology job, and then shifted interests after the dot-com bust.

### Chapter 7: Getting Married, Fighting depression, Overcoming the Great Recession by returning to Tech (2008 - Present)

As hard as it is to imagine now with the markets going gangbusters, back when I was discharged in December 2008, hiring was frozen, people were still getting laid off left-and-right, and my childhood home was getting foreclosed on. I remember spending days handcrafting a cover letter for an \$50k/year IT Help Desk position at a VA Hospital, only to get rejected in favor of one of the many laid off tech workers flocking to something secure with health insurance. Like many millennials, I ended up taking refuge in grad school, first at Georgetown and then later at Illinois Tech. I learned Java and this new thing called AWS, and I was able to network my way into a job at IBM, kicking off my post-Army career in tech.

The eight years of my tech career has been blur of different projects that required me to learn new skills. Broadly, I rode the initial hype wave of cloud computing. I worked on cloud management tools at IBM, evangelized modern cloud architectures at the FAA, and now I build AI-powered IT operations tools at Decipher. As time allowed, I took on side gigs during nights and weekends, largely using JavaScript and PHP. I'd always found web development to be a better creative outlet than writing Enterprise things in Java or automating cloud deployments in Python, so when I finally got a bit more financially secure, I pivoted to shift from backend languages to fullstack JavaScript via a nanodegree at Udacity and a three-month sabbatical to complete the Fullstack Academy Software Engineering program on a veteran scholarship.

Since the web development community is super young, I now generally find myself playing the role of senior engineer on most projects. This has forced me to stretch my leadership and coaching muscles a bit and dedicate time to work through my reading list of software engineering books. It's kinda weird, but I'm getting to the point where I like reading about design patterns and agile methodologies. Whoda thunk it? I've also gotten to the point where people I've mentored have started to go gangbusters as software journey(wo)men. This makes me feel a bit like a software O.G. (original gangsta), but the constant churn of frontend technologies forces me to keep on my toes and regularly delivers the sort of dopamine burst i first got when I popped in the Windows 95 CD-ROM and my mid-90s homebuilt PC first came to life.

It's hard to say what language or frameworks I might be using a few years from now, but I feel like my nerdy technical chops and my military grit put me in a good place to keep up. Each passing year, I feel like my rough edges are getting a bit more worn down, helping me become a better version of myself. I also become more cognizant of the many small blessings that have allowed me to live this amazing life.
