As I've gotten older and gained perspective on my life, I've concluded that many aspects of my personality and career have been broadly shaped by the era, location, and community of my childhood. In this blog series, "How I got Here," I plan to retrospect on a few different periods of my life and some of their lasting influences on my professional pursuits and hobbies.

[In chapter three, I discussed the dark three year period when I went through substantial bullying at school.](/how-i-got-here-chapter-2) This chapter covers the next thee years from 1998 until around 2001, when I regained confidence, got my first technology job, and then shifted interests after the dot-com bust.

### Chapter 5: Short and Unremarkable Military Service

### JROTC, West Point, and the Army (2001 - 2008)

Beyond computers, my one other big interest at this stage was the military. Both of my grandfathers were veterans, and hearing their stories made me associate military with interesting experiences and character development. Plus, since my high school was right by a major Air Force base, most of my classmates were the children of military families. As the one person in my eighth grade class that couldn't afford to go on the Washington DC class trip, hearing them talk about living outside of California (or even abroad) seemed exciting. This led me to join my high school Junior ROTC unit.

In contrast to computers, which had always been a very solitary activity that involved interact more with adults than people my own age, JROTC was the first time that I was able to develop a sense of comradery and friendship. To this day, my best friend remains Aser Tolentino, a fellow JROTC cadet. So when the dot-com bubble burst and the 9/11 attack happened, I shifted my priorities around. Rather than trying to get a tech job, I decided to instead join the military. I applied to West Point, VMI, and the Citadel based on the suggestions of my instructors, and I planned to enlist in the Army if I didn't get into one of those. Ultimately, I got into West Point, which took my life in a very different direction.

Thinking back, my experiences at West Point and in the Army turned me into a gritty person that's comfortable stepping in to lead when needed. I excelled at academics, did reasonably well leading teams, and sucked at pushups. I got a C+ in Gymnastics, and I raised my hands in praise to the heavens that I didn't failed. I got punched in the face in boxing, I drove a tank around during summer training, and I did a semester abroad at the German Military Academy, which gave me my first taste of traveling overseas. I got a pair of crossed sabers mounted on a plaque for doing well in computer science coursework. Those sabers and my lingering affinity for strong types are that only thing that I've ever really gotten out of learning [Ada 95, a computer language you've likely never heard of](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xpFKvWgC7Q).

If the Army had had Cyberwarfare Officers back when I was commissioned, I think I likely would have gone that route, but alas, I was a decade early. Instead I chose what I thought best combined my technical interests with my warrior spirit: Aviation. I envisioned targeting computers, cool headsets, hellfire missiles flying down at the enemy. I did great at that [TIE-Fighter game](https://youtu.be/ZB_NSpUmIUU?t=38s), so this must be a cinch. I showed up at flight school pumped for my future career. Nine months later, I was judged medically unfit to fly. Nine months after that, I was medically discharged and again a civilian.
