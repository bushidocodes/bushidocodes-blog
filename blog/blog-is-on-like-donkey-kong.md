I am often surprised by how quickly time can fly by. At the beginning of this year, I was an IBM System z Client Architect based out of Chicago. Despite the day-to-day stress of being in a demanding job and setting high career expectations for myself, I was largely copasetic. Certainly, I was unaware of the large changes that would soon occur in my life. Over the past six months, I&#8217;ve graduated from my Masters Program at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180911111809/http://www.iit.edu/" target="_blank">Illinois Tech</a>, celebrated my wife&#8217;s completion of her medical degree, moved to Bethesda, Maryland, and joined the Linux and z/VM team of the Washington Systems Center. In my new role, I&#8217;ll be closely working with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180911111809/http://www.linkedin.com/pub/richard-lewis/15/716/12a/" target="_blank">Richard Lewis</a>, a longtime mainframer of renown and sworn Knight of VM (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20180911111809/http://www2.marist.edu/~mvmua/knights.html" target="_blank">yes, there actually are mainframe knights</a>). Later this summer, I&#8217;ll be teaching my first semester of the Intro to Mainframe Technologies course that I designed for Illinois Tech.

To the readers and fans out there, I really appreciate your forbearance and understanding as I&#8217;ve gotten my personal life in order.

In short, it's back on like Donkey Kong.
