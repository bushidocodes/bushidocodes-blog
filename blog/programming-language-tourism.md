A key assumption behind my decision to go back to grad school was that I would be free to engage in passion projects and creative coding. Alas, phrases like "that does not sufficiently advance the state-of-the-art" or "that is too engineering-centric" turn out to be the academic equivalent of something failing to demonstrate sufficient near-term business value. As a result, I've decided to deallocate time from graduate studies and research this summer to pursue projects that fulfill me.

The first of these passion projects is working through [Bruce A. Tate](https://twitter.com/redrapids)’s [Seven Languages in Seven Weeks](https://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks). I am attracted to this book precisely because it is impractical. You don’t gain mastery of any programming languages. Rather, you get the chance to explore and complete a series of coding katas to expand your mind about the art of programming. This is the programming language equivalent of backpacking around Europe with a Rick Steve's Guide. I want to explore new cultures and see how others do things and take this apprecation back with me when I return home.

Over the next few weeks, I'm going to be uploading a series of blog posts forming my "travel log" for this journey. Here are the languages that are on the itinerary:

- Ruby
- Io
- Prolog
- Scala
- Erlang
- Clojure
- Haskell

With the slight exception of Scala, I haven’t worked with any of these languages before, so my exposure will largely be fresh and confined to the brief tour provided by Bruce Tate. As much as possible, I will try to link and provide interactive online REPLs to show aspects of the languages that I find most compelling.

Stay tuned!
