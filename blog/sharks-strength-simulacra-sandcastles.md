Some species of sharks need to stay in motion to stay alive <br/>
If oxygen-rich water is not flowing across their gills, they cannot breathe <br/>
Thus it is for many species of software engineers <br/>
If dopamine-inducing code is not flowing across our keyboards, we start to choke <br/>

Without licenses to point at to demonstrate our qualifications <br/>
We engage in a continuous internal dialectic that demands periodic feats of intellectual strength <br/>
Hercules or Bust <br/>

Ours is the Grand Masquerade <br/>
Externally wrapping our Simulacra in the languages and frameworks of the season <br/>
Internally grappling with the cost of keeping up <br/>

Lo, how we distract ourselves with our digital sandcastles
