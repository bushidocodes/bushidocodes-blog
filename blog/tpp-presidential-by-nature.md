T.P.P., how can I explain it

I'll take it frame by frame it

To have y'all all jumping, shouting, saying it

T is for Trans, P is for Pacific, scratch your temple

The last P, well that's not that simple

It's sort of like, well, another way to break down trade restrictions

It's eleven little letters that are missing here

You get on occasion if party brothers aren’t defamin’

It seems I gotta start the explaining, bust it

You ever had a dream and bet it all because YOLO

You submit your favorite bill then left feeling real mellow

You get home, wait a day it’s what you wanna know about

Then you pull up the Internet and it’s a real madhouse?!

It’s not a stunt, a S to the T to the U to the N to the T;

It's cause the Unions' at the house

With Warren and Pelosi

It's TPP, time other people's what you get it

There's no room for statemanship there's just room to hit it

How many brothers out there know just what I'm getting at

Who think it's wrong cause I was gritting and outwitting that

Well if you do, that's T.P.P. and you're not down with it

But if you don't, here's your membership

You down with T.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)

You down with T.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)

You down with T.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)

Who’s down with T.P.P.? (Every last penny)

You down with T.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)

You down with T.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)

You down with T.P.P.? (Yeah, you know me)

Who’s down with T.P.P.? (All the homies)
