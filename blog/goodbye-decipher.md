All good things come to an end, and with Grey Matter Dashboard at 2.0, I've decided that it's now a appropriate time for me to pass the baton and move on from Decipher. It was an honor to be a part of the Grey Matter team and have the opportunity to help build a new major software product from the ground up!

I‚Äôm thankful to David Tillery, John Cudd, and Josh Rutherford for giving me a üëç back during my Decipher interview back in February 2017, and I'm also thankful to my Decipher comrades-in-code that fought shoulder-to-shoulder against the void of the blank editor, stared down tight deadlines, and willed into existence something new in form and function out of electrons, sweat, and pure thought stuff.

In no particular order, here are a handful of photos of some fun times at Decipher. Lots of great memories and great friends!
